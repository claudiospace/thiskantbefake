## Is Fake News New?

What is Fake News? Why people create it? Why people believe in it? Why is it dangerous?

With those questions in mind, we created educational resources for learners to be introduced to the topic of Fake News using gamification. We also created teacher support to better use the game as resource in the classroom.

### Why Kant?

We inspired our game on Kantian ideas about the relation between ethics and politics, the role of the emotions in political spechees, the public and the private use of reason and the relationship between the reason and the structural bases for the search of the truth. In our game, we present Kant in the form of a chameleon helps the character going through the Fake News challenges.

Our game is currently a playable prototype to give an idea of how can we teach the topic of Fake News using gamification.

Learn by doing. We learn how to convey and apply different learning approaches and theories in this project. We also had the chance to deal with production aspects and teamwork collaboration.
