This Kant Be Fake!
======================

:star: An educational game that helps students differentiate between real versus **fake news**.

This website, game and chatbot are prototypes created as part of the course **Edutech Design Challenge**.

Master's in **Educational Technology** - Saarland University.

## Is Fake News New?

What is Fake News? Why do people create it? Why do people believe in it? Why is it dangerous?

With those questions in mind, we created educational resources for learners to be introduced to the topic of Fake News using gamification. We also created teacher support better to use the game as a resource in the classroom.

### Why Kant?

We were inspired by Kantian ideas about the relation between ethics and politics, the role of the emotions in political speeches, the public and the private use of reason and the relationship between reason and the structural bases for the search for the truth. In our game, we present Kant in the form of a chameleon (a Chatbot), who helps the character go through the Fake News challenges.

Our game is currently a playable prototype to give an idea of how we can teach the topic of Fake News using gamification.
**Note**: Some of the components are not available anymore in the prototype.

## What makes the game unique?

We developed activities that are well embedded in the game plot for a more authentic learning experience.
You can [take a look](https://mm.tt/1768236376?t=9dcNwygvsR) at our planned activities map and activities sample.

## What did we learn
Learn by doing. We learn how to convey and apply different learning approaches and theories in this project. We also had the chance to deal with production aspects and teamwork collaboration.

### Our Content Production

We worked very hard to create all the content available.
